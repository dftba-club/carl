# DFTBA.CLUB Mastodon Bot

This is a simple Mastodon Bot written in Python for the [DFTBA.Club Mastodon Server](https://dftba.club).
It uses env variables so it can certainly be deployed on any other instance but the features are centered around monitoring
for relevant podcast and YouTube channel updates for the community.
